                    designing, implementing, and managing databases using desktop and mobile devices. 
                    As well as using Structured Query Language (SQL) to build databases and manipulate
                     data for future work in data processing, GIS analysis, and cartographic presentation. </p>
                <p>One database service we offer is designing a survey using Survey123. Our Survey123 services include
			meeting all your data requirements with data integrity and efficiency and creating an easy-to-use 
			survey user interface!</p>
                <p>Another database service we offer is designing a database in Access. Our database 
                    design service is assembling data from various sources and creating databases. 
                    The created database will be efficient, with data cohesiveness, and no data lost! </p>

              <p>Coding with python is around you probably more than is known. It can be used in many different applications,
                but the main one we specialize in is coding for ArcGIS Pro.

              <p>The photo shown is the creation of an expression and query being used to calculate the field called "ValidDate"
                on the right side. In the expression, there is a combination of splitting the original data, comparing the years
                in "yearBuilt" and "CompDate", checking if the month has a day that does not exceed its maximum, and an if else
                statement to check these conditions.
