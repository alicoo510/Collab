				CKL_TREE_REMOTESENSING layer for trees collected via remote sensing. This schema details field names,

				The supervisor uses this survey to validate the community's requests, confirm if they are authentic,

				The Field Crew populates the attributes of records marked as "in process" by the supervisors and has

				<p>This survey has the functionality to work offline in areas without internet coverage and geofencing

				<p>The need to optimize operations by using programming languages was identified during the development of the Project</p>
				<p>The sequential process followed to optimize the operations is shown below:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Identification of tasks to automate within the data flow</li>
						<li>The tasks were performed for an example dummy data in ArcGIS Pro</li>
						<li>Export the geoprocessing code from ArcGIS Pro to a .py file</li>
						<li>Determine the scripts orders according to the workflow objectives</li>
						<li>Script editing for use in the cloud input layers, temporary layers, condition statements and queries</li>
						<li>Local testing and task scheduling using the windows task scheduler as requested by the client</li>

          <p>The basemap was created by selecting out polygons based on the ownership field which creates a separate feature class only owned by the 
            city this included roads, road allowances, parks, and other various city property. 
            Creating a visually appealing basemap takes time and choosing colours that reflect the importance of each area is key. Creating a custom
             green indicating city areas needed to be visually distinguishable from the grey toned down areas which are private areas. 
            Creating visibility ranges for labels is also key to keeping the map simple and distinguishable at all levels. 
            Context was needed so there is not a floating map in space there had to be areas like other municipalities that were added to create a map in context. 
        </p>
      <p>This ArcGIS Pro file is then converted into a vector tile file and uploaded onto ArcOnline to create a custom basemap.</p></div>

          <p>The dashboard is an internal facing application for the supervisor to show statistics on 
            the jobs done and those that still need to be looked at. as well this dashboard serves as a 
            portal to the validation survey for the supervisor. This dashboard has personal information on it
             and so should only be seen by the supervisor or their equals for security reasons. Some of the public 
             wants to be contacted this information is available in the map where the supervisor can search for the record 
             based off location or tree request ID.</p>
            <p>This dashboard is active based on the map the records and list change as well as the chart that shows the
               trees conditions this can be helpful for storm damage where the conditions of trees in proximity may be all 
               damaged it is visible on this dashboard.
